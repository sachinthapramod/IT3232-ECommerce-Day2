# Introduction to Spring Boot

Spring Boot is a powerful framework built on top of the Spring Framework that simplifies the development of Java applications, especially web applications. One of its key features is its seamless integration with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, which is widely used for developing scalable web applications.



# What is Spring Boot MVC?
Spring Boot MVC is an implementation of the traditional Spring MVC framework but with auto-configuration, embedded servers, and minimal setup. It follows the MVC design pattern, which separates the application into three main components:

‚úÖ Model (M) ‚Üí Represents the data and business logic.

‚úÖ View (V) ‚Üí Handles UI and presentation (e.g., HTML, Thymeleaf).

‚úÖ Controller (C) ‚Üí Manages the request processing and interacts with Model and View.

This separation makes the application more maintainable and scalable.



# How Spring Boot Works with MVC
1Ô∏è‚É£ Client (Browser/Postman) sends an HTTP request.

2Ô∏è‚É£ DispatcherServlet (Front Controller) receives the request.

3Ô∏è‚É£ It maps the request to an appropriate Controller using @RequestMapping.

4Ô∏è‚É£ The Controller interacts with the Model (business logic/database).

5Ô∏è‚É£ The Controller returns data to the View (e.g., HTML, JSON, Thymeleaf).

6Ô∏è‚É£ The response is sent back to the client.
